# Match-ee

Match-ee is a Memory Game for ages 3 years and above.

## How to play

Players are to click and find a match of the cards, a total of 6 pairs. Once a player has click on two cards, a pop up will appear to confirm if it's a match or not a match. Correctly matched cards will be turned over and will be represented by another card, and non clickable. Player will have the option to replay the game again once all cards have found it's match.

## Design

The concept of the design is to make it colourful, interactive and interesting for young kids to retain their attention. With a slight animation when Player hover over the cards to make the card interact with the Player. There's different pop up colour to also represent the different pop ups.

## Sound Design

Added sound effects with every pop up which differs with a match, not match and a completed round after all cards have found their match.
